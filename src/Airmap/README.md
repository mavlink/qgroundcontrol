## To be deleted when development is complete

*    "Required" rules must be pre-selectd and cannot be unselected by the user

*    AirMapRestrictionManager seems to be incomplete (if not redundant). Shouldn't we use the array of AirSpace items returned by AirMapAdvisoryManager instead? In addition to the AirSpace object, it gives you a color to use in order of importance.

*    Traffic monitor timeout is now set to 2 minutes following instructions from Thomas Vo√ü.

* Check rules sorting order

* Group rules jurisdictions

* ~Add a "Wrong Way" icon to the airspace widget when not connected~
