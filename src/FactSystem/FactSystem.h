/// The components of the FactSystem are a Fact which holds an individual value. FactMetaData holds
/// additional meta data associated with a Fact such as description, min/max ranges and so forth.
/// The FactValidator object is a QML validator which validates input according to the FactMetaData
/// settings. Client code can then use this system to expose sets of Facts to QML code. An example
/// of this is the PX4ParameterFacts onbject which is part of the PX4 AutoPilot plugin. It exposes
/// the firmware parameters to QML such that you can bind QML ui elements directly to parameters.
