# QGroundControl

## Video Streaming

For supported platforms, QGroundControl implements an UDP RTP video streaming receiver in its Main Flight Display. It used gstreamer and a stripped down version of QtGstreamer.
To build video streaming support, you will need to install the GStreamer development packages.

TODO: Complete this once the PR is through.
