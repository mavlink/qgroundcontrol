MAVLink's reference implementation is done in the QGroundControl operator control unit. MAVLink is however not tied in any way to QGroundControl nor does it depend on it. Many other groundstations (APM Planner, HK GCS, Copter-GCS) support it and might be better suited for your application than QGC - check them out.
