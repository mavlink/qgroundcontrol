| BAT_V_EMPTY     | 0.9    | 100.0  | 3.2      | 1           | 1       | Voltage of an empty battery cell  |
| BAT_V_FULL      | 1.0    | 200.0  | 4.05     | 1           | 1       | Voltage of a full battery cell    |
| BAT_N_CELLS     | 1      | 100    | 3        | 1           | 1       | Number of SERIAL battery cells. Typically this ranges from 2S to 6S in small-scale UAVs  |
| BAT_V_SCALING   | 0.001  | 1.0    | 0.00838  | 1           | 1       | Conversion from ADC ticks to battery voltage. Depends on the connected board, calibrate with a multimeter.  |
| MC_ATTRATE_P    | 0.0    | 20.0   | 0.20     | 1           | 1       | Multirotor attitude rate control P gain. This gain controls how much of the motor thrust should be used to control angular velocity. A larger number will increase the control response, but will make the system also more twitchy. |
| MC_ATTRATE_D    | 0.0    | 20.0   | 0.05     | 1           | 1       | Multirotor attitude rate control D gain. A large value will allow to damp oscillations due to a high P gain, but will make the system response suspectible to noise.|
| MC_ATT_P    | 0.0    | 20.0   | 0.20     | 1           | 1       | Multirotor attitude control proportional (P) gain. This defines how strong the response of the system will be to an attitude error|
| MC_ATT_D    | 0.0    | 20.0   | 0.05     | 1           | 1       | Multirotor attitude control D gain. A large value will allow to damp oscillations due to a high P gain, but will make the system response suspectible to noise.|
| FW_ROLLRATE_P    | 0.0    | 20.0   | 0.30     | 1           | 1       | Fixed wing roll rate control P gain. This gain controls how strong the ailerons or rudder should be actuated in order to achieve a certain roll rate. A larger number will increase the control response, but will make the system also more twitchy. |
| FW_HEADING_P    | 0.0    | 20.0   | 4.00     | 1           | 1       | Fixed wing heading error to bank angle gain |
