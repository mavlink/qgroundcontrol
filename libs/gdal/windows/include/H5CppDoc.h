 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The C++ API provides C++ wrappers for the HDF5 C Library.
 * 
 * It is assumed that the user has knowledge of the HDF5 file format and its
 * components.  For more information on the HDF5 C Library, please refer to
 * the HDF5 Software Documentation page.
 *
 * Because the HDF5 C Library maps very well to
 * the object oriented design approach, classes in the C++ API can
 * closely represent the interfaces of the C APIs as follows:
 *
 * \verbatim
    HDF5 C APIs                       C++ Classes
    -----------                       -----------
    Attribute Interface (H5A)         Attribute
    Datasets Interface (H5D)          DataSet
    Error Interface (H5E)             Exception
    File Interface (H5F)              H5File
    Group Interface (H5G)             Group
    Identifier Interface (H5I)        IdComponent
    Property List Interface (H5P)     PropList and subclasses
    Dataspace Interface (H5S)         DataSpace
    Datatype Interface (H5T)          DataType and subclasses
  \endverbatim
 *
 * This <a href="./C2Cppfunction_map.htm">
 * table </a> provides a map from the C APIs to the C++ member functions.
 * <br />
 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * The HDF5 C++ API is included with the HDF5 source code and can 
 * be obtained from 
 * 
 * Please refer to the release_docs/INSTALL file under the top directory 
 * of the HDF5 source code for information about installing, building, 
 * and testing the C++ API.
