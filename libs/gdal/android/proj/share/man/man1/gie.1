.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgie\fP, the Geospatial Integrity Investigation Environment, is a
regression testing environment for the PROJ transformation library. Its primary
design goal is to be able to perform regression testing of code that are a part
of PROJ, while not requiring any other kind of tooling than the same C compiler
already employed for compiling the library.

Tests for \fBgie\fP are defined in simple text files. Usually having the
extension \fB\&.gie\fP\&. Test for \fBgie\fP are written in the purpose\-build command language for gie.
The basic functionality of the gie command language is implemented through just
3 command verbs: \fBoperation\fP, which defines the PROJ operation to test,
\fBaccept\fP, which defines the input coordinate to read, and \fBexpect\fP, which
defines the result to expect.
.sp
A sample test file for \fBgie\fP that uses the three above basic commands looks
like:

.sp
Parsing of a \fBgie\fP file starts at \fB<gie>\fP and ends when \fB</gie>\fP
is reached. Anything before \fB<gie>\fP and after \fB</gie>\fP is not considered.
Test cases are created by defining an \fI\%operation\fP which
\fI\%accept\fP an input coordinate and \fI\%expect\fP an output
coordinate.
.sp
Because \fBgie\fP tests are wrapped in the \fB<gie>\fP/\fB</gie>\fP tags it is
also possible to add test cases to custom made init files\&.
The tests will be ignore by PROJ when reading the init file with \fI+init\fP and
\fBgie\fP ignores anything not wrapped in \fB<gie>\fP/\fB</gie>\fP\&.
.sp
\fBgie\fP tests are defined by a set of commands like \fI\%operation\fP,
\fI\%accept\fP and \fI\%expect\fP in the example above. Together the
commands make out the \fBgie\fP command language. Any line in a
\fBgie\fP file that does not start with a command is ignored. In the
example above it is seen how this can be used to add comments and styling to
\fBgie\fP test files in order to make them more readable as well as
documenting what the purpose of the various tests are.
.sp
Below the \fI\%gie command language\fP is explained in details.

.TP
.B operation <+args>
Define a PROJ operation to test. Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
operation proj=utm zone=32 ellps=GRS80
# test 4D function

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B accept <x y [z [t]]>
Define the input coordinate to read. Takes test coordinate. The coordinate
can be defined by either 2, 3 or 4 values, where the first two values are
the x\- and y\-components, the 3rd is the z\-component and the 4th is the time
component. The number of components in the coordinate determines which
version of the operation is tested (2D, 3D or 4D). Many coordinates can be
accepted for one \fI\%operation\fP\&. For each \fI\%accept\fP an
accompanying \fI\%expect\fP is needed.
.sp
Note that \fBgie\fP accepts the underscore (\fB_\fP) as a thousands
separator. It is not required (in fact, it is entirely ignored by the
input routine), but it significantly improves the readability of the very
long strings of numbers typically required in projected coordinates.
.sp
See \fI\%operation\fP for an example.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B expect <x y [z [t]]> | <error code>
Define the expected coordinate that will be returned from accepted
coordinate passed though an operation. The expected coordinate can be
defined by either 2, 3 or 4 components, similarly to \fI\%accept\fP\&.
Many coordinates can be expected for one \fI\%operation\fP\&. For each
\fI\%expect\fP an accompanying \fI\%accept\fP is needed.
.sp
See \fI\%operation\fP for an example.
.sp
In addition to expecting a coordinate it is also possible to expect a
PROJ error code in case an operation can’t be created. This is useful when
testing that errors are caught and handled correctly. Below is an example of
that tests that the pipeline operator fails correctly when a non\-invertible
pipeline is constructed.

.TP
.B tolerance <tolerance>
The \fI\%tolerance\fP command controls how much accepted coordinates
can deviate from the expected coordinate. This is handy to test that an
operation meets a certain numerical tolerance threshold. Some operations
are expected to be accurate within millimeters where others might only be
accurate within a few meters. \fI\%tolerance\fP should

The default tolerance is 0.5 mm. See \fBproj \-lu\fP for a list of possible
units.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B roundtrip <n> <tolerance>
Do a roundtrip test of an operation. \fI\%roundtrip\fP needs a
\fI\%operation\fP and a \fI\%accept\fP command
to function. The accepted coordinate is passed to the operation first in
it’s forward mode, then the output from the forward operation is passed
back to the inverse operation. This procedure is done \fBn\fP times. If the
resulting coordinate is within the set tolerance of the initial coordinate,
the test is passed.

.B direction <direction>
The \fI\%direction\fP command specifies in which direction an operation
is performed. This can either be \fBforward\fP or \fBinverse\fP\&. An example of
this is seen below where it is tested that a symmetrical transformation
pipeline returns the same results in both directions.

operation proj=pipeline zone=32 step

accept 12 55 0 0
expect 12 55 0 0

# Now the inverse direction (still same result: the pipeline is symmetrical)

presence is required.

.SH BACKGROUND
.sp
More importantly than being an acronym for “Geospatial Integrity Investigation
Environment”, gie were also the initials, user id, and USGS email address of
Gerald Ian Evenden (1935–2016), the geospatial visionary, who, already in the
1980s, started what was to become the PROJ of today.
.sp
Gerald’s clear vision was that map projections are \fIjust special functions\fP\&.
Some of them rather complex, most of them of two variables, but all of them
\fIjust special functions\fP, and not particularly more special than the \fBsin()\fP,
\fBcos()\fP, \fBtan()\fP, and \fBhypot()\fP already available in the C standard library.
.sp
And hence, according to Gerald, \fIthey should not be particularly much harder
to use\fP, for a programmer, than the \fBsin()\fP’s, \fBtan()\fP’s and
\fBhypot()\fP’s so readily available.
.sp
Gerald’s ingenuity also showed in the implementation of the vision, where
he devised a comprehensive, yet simple, system of key\-value pairs for
parameterising a map projection, and the highly flexible \fBPJ\fP struct, storing
run\-time compiled versions of those key\-value pairs, hence making a map
projection function call, \fBpj_fwd(PJ, point)\fP, as easy as a traditional function
call like \fBhypot(x,y)\fP\&.
.sp
While today, we may have more formally well defined metadata systems (most
prominent the OGC WKT2 representation), nothing comes close being as easily
readable (“human compatible”) as Gerald’s key\-value system. This system in
particular, and the PROJ system in general, was Gerald’s great gift to anyone
using and/or communicating about geodata.
.sp
It is only reasonable to name a program, keeping an eye on the
integrity of the PROJ system, in honour of Gerald.
.sp
So in honour, and hopefully also in the spirit, of Gerald Ian Evenden
(1935–2016), this is the Geospatial Integrity Investigation Environment.
