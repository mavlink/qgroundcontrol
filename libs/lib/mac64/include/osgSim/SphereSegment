/**
A SphereSegment is a Geode to represent an portion of a sphere (potentially
the whole sphere). The sphere is aligned such that the line through the
sphere's poles is parallel to the z axis. The sphere segment
may be rendered various components switched on or off:

    - The specified area of the sphere surface.

    - An edge line around the boundary of the specified area
      of the sphere surface.

    - Four <i>spokes</i>, where a spoke is the line from
      the sphere's centre to a corner of the rendered area.

    - Four planar areas, where the planar areas are formed
      between the spokes.

Caveats:

    - It's worth noting that the line through the sphere's poles is
      parallel to the z axis. This has implications when specifying the
      area to be rendered, and specifying areas where the centre of
      the rendered area <i>is</i> the Z axis may lead to unexpected
      geometry.

    - It's possible to render the whole sphere by specifying elevation
      and azimuth ranges round the full 360 degrees. When doing
      so you may consider switching the planes, spokes, and edge lines
      off, to avoid rendering artefacts, e.g. the upper and lower
      planes will be coincident.
