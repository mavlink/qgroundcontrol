.TH XBEE_GETPACKET 3  2009-11-01 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
xbee_getpacket, xbee_getpacketwait
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <xbee.h>
.sp
.BI "xbee_pkt *xbee_getpacket(xbee_con *" con ");"
.sp
.BI "xbee_pkt *xbee_getpacketwait(xbee_con *" con ");"
.ad b
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR xbee_getpacket ()
function will return the next avaliable packet for the provided connection.
It takes 1 argument.
.sp
The argument
.I con
points to a connection made previously with
.BR xbee_newcon ().
.sp
The
.BR xbee_getpacketwait ()
function behaves the same, but will wait for an internally specified time for a packet to arrive (currently around 1 second).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful return, this function returns the packet, having unlinked it from the internal list.
You must keep hold of the packet until you are finished with it, and then you must
.BR free ()
it to prevent memory leaks.
.sp
If a packet was not avaliable for the provided connection, a
.B NULL
is returned.
.sp
If an error occured a
.B NULL
is also returned (though unlikely).
.sp
For more information on the structure of the packet, please see
.BR xbee_pkt (3)
.sp
For information on using callback functions with connections instead, please see
.BR xbee_con (3)
or
.B callback.c
in the SVN sample directory.
.SH EXAMPLE
To recieve a packet from a previously made connection:
.in +4n
.nf
#include <xbee.h>
xbee_pkt *pkt;
if ((pkt = xbee_getpacket(con)) != NULL) {
  /* process packet... */
  free(pkt);
}
.fi
