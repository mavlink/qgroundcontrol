.TH XBEE_GETPACKET 3  2009-11-01 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
xbee_hasanalog, xbee_getanalog
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <xbee.h>
.sp
.BI "int xbee_hasanalog(xbee_pkt *" pkt ", int " sample ", int " input ");"
.sp
.BI "double xbee_getanalog(xbee_pkt *" pkt ", int " sample ", int " input ", double " Vref ");"
.ad b
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR xbee_hasanalog ()
function will check the packet for the presence of an analog sample on the specified input.
.sp
The
.BR xbee_getanalog ()
function will read the packet and return the sample value for the specified analog input.
.sp
They both take 3 arguments, with the same purposes.
.sp
The argument
.I pkt
points to a packet that was previously retrieved with 
.BR xbee_getpacket ()
.sp
The argument
.I sample
selects the sample within the packet to use.
.sp
The argument
.I input
specifies which input you are interested in testing.
.sp
.BR xbee_getanalog ()
also takes a fourth argument that allows you to provide a
.I Vref
value. This allows the function to convert the raw ADC value into a voltage for you.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.BR xbee_hasanalog ()
function will return
.B 1
if the provided packet has sample data for the specified input, otherwise
.BR 0 .
.sp
The
.BR xbee_getanalog ()
function will return the raw ADC value (0 - 1023) if the provided packet has sample data for the specified input and Vref was given as zero.
If Vref was non-zero, then the return value will be the voltage read.
A
.B -1
will be returned if the packet does not contain sample data.
.sp
.SH EXAMPLE
To read sample data from previously made connection:
.in +4n
.nf
#include <xbee.h>
xbee_pkt *pkt;
double Vref = 3.3;
if ((pkt = xbee_getpacket(con)) != NULL) {
  if (xbee_hasanalog(pkt,0,0)) {
    printf("A0 read %fv\\n",xbee_getanalog(pkt,0,0,Vref));
  } else {
    printf("No A0 data\\n");
  }
  free(pkt);
}
.fi
