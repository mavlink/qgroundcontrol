.SH NAME
libxbee
.SH DESCRIPTION
libxbee is a C library to aid the use of Series 1 Digi XBee radios running in API mode (AP=2).
.sp
I have tried to keep flexibility to a maximum.
By allowing connections to individual nodes to be created - you don't have to address each packet,
or filter through incomming packets to get at the one you are after. This is all taken care of
for you by
.BR libxbee
!
.sp
