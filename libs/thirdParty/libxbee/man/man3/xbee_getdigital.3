.TH XBEE_GETPACKET 3  2009-11-01 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
xbee_hasdigital, xbee_getdigital
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <xbee.h>
.sp
.BI "int xbee_hasdigital(xbee_pkt *" pkt ", int " sample ", int " input ");"
.sp
.BI "int xbee_getdigital(xbee_pkt *" pkt ", int " sample ", int " input ");"
.ad b
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR xbee_hasdigital ()
function will check the packet for the presence of a given sample on the specified input.
.sp
The
.BR xbee_getdigital ()
function will read the packet and return the sample value for the specified input.
.sp
They both take 3 arguments, with the same purposes.
.sp
The argument
.I pkt
points to a packet that was previously retrieved with 
.BR xbee_getpacket ()
.sp
The argument
.I sample
selects the sample within the packet to use.
.sp
The argument
.I input
specifies which input you are interested in testing.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
.BR xbee_hasdigital ()
function will return
.B 1
if the provided packet has sample data for the specified input, otherwise
.BR 0 .
.sp
The
.BR xbee_getdigital ()
function will return
.B 1
if the provided packet has sample data for the specified input and the sample was HIGH.
A
.B 0
will be returned if the sample was LOW, or the packet does not contain sample data.
.sp
.SH EXAMPLE
To read sample data from previously made connection:
.in +4n
.nf
#include <xbee.h>
xbee_pkt *pkt;
if ((pkt = xbee_getpacket(con)) != NULL) {
  if (xbee_hasdigital(pkt,0,0)) {
    printf("D0 read %d\n",xbee_getdigital(pkt,0));
  } else {
    printf("No D0 data\n");
  }
  free(pkt);
}
