Welcome to libxbee!

I have proveded sample code in the ./sample directory. Hopefully this will help
get you up and running with libxbee. If you would like samples showing a different
aspect of libxbee, then please do not hesitate to file an 'issue' on the project
site, and I will get to it ASAP:
  http://code.google.com/p/libxbee/issues/list


Documentation is avaliable as HTML in the 'doc' folder.


Please note that this project is still in development, so should not be used for
any purpose other than learning/playing/testing etc... Basically don't use it to
make money, and then hold me responsible if it breaks!

Feel free to contact me directly with any queries:
