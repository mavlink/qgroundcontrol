Building on Unix
----------------

1) run ./configure to generate build scripts
   Note: type ./configure --help for a list of fine-tuning options

2) type "make" 

3) type "make check" to perform self-tests

4) type "make install" to install


Building on Windows
-------------------

If you have run the VC++ VCVARS32.BAT, you should be able to type the 
following in a command window to build the code and executables:

C:>  nmake /f makefile.vc 

Otherwise create your own VC++ project.  There aren't many files to deal with
here!
