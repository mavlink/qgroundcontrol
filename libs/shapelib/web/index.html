<h1>Shapefile C Library</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

The Shapefile C Library provides the ability to write simple C programs
for reading, writing and updating (to a limited extent) ESRI Shapefiles,
and the associated attribute file (.dbf).<p>

<h2>Supporting Information</h2>

<h2>What is a Shapefile?</h2>

If you don't know, you probably don't need this library.  The Shapefile
format is a working and interchange format promulagated by 
<a href="http://www.esri.com/">ESRI</a> for simple vector data with attributes.
<p>

An excellent <a href="dl/shapefile.pdf">white paper</a> on the shapefile format 
is available from ESRI,
but it is .pdf format, so you will need Adobe Acrobat to browse it.<p>

The file format actually consists of three files.<p>

<pre>
XXX.shp - holds the actual vertices.
XXX.shx - hold index data pointing to the structures in the .shp file.
XXX.dbf - holds the attributes in xBase (dBase) format.  
</pre>

<h2>Download</h2>

Source code, and some other odds and ends can be downloaded from
<a href="http://download.osgeo.org/shapelib">http://download.osgeo.org/shapelib</a>.<p>

Shapelib is available for anonymous CVS access:

<h2>Bugs, Maintainance and Support</h2>

This library is maintained by <a href="http://pobox.com/~warmerdam">Frank 
Warmerdam</a>.  Please send me bug reports, patches and suggestions for the 
library via the <a href="http://bugzilla.maptools.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Shapelib">maptools.org Bugzilla</a>.  Shapelib bugs can also be
<a href="http://bugzilla.maptools.org/query.cgi?product=Shapelib">queried</a>.
<p>

Shapelib is hosted at 
<a href="http://shapelib.maptools.org">shapelib.maptools.org</a>.   A mailing
list for discussion of how to use shapelib, and announcing new releases 
<a href="http://lists.maptools.org/mailman/listinfo/shapelib/">is 
available</a>.  To only find out about new releases of Shapelib select the 
"<i>Subscribe to new releases</i>" option from the link at 
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/shapelib/">Freshmeat</a>.<p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

I didn't start this section anywhere near soon enough, so alot of earlier
contributors to Shapelib are lost in pre-history.

<ul>
<li> Bill Miller (NY-DOT) for shputils.c
<li> Carl Anderson for the contents of the contrib directory, and 
the "tuple" additions to dbfopen.c.
<li> Andrea Giacomelli for patches for dbfopen.c.
<li> Doug Matthews for portability improvements.
<li> Jan-Oliver Wagner for convincing me to make it available under LGPL,
shared library support, and various other patches.
<li> Dennis Christopher (of Avenza) for testing and bug fixes.
<li> Miko Syrjä (of 3D-system Oy) for a record size bug fix.
<li> Steven Lime and Curtis Hill for help with NULL shapes.
<li> Jim Matthews for support of NULL attributes in dbf files.
<li> <a href="http://www.pcigeomatics.com/">PCI Geomatics</a> who let me
release a modified version of their shapefile code in the beginning and
who hosted shapelib for years.
</ul>

<h2>In Memorium</h2>

I would like to dedicate Shapelib to the memory of Sol Katz.  While I never
met him in person, his generous contributions to the GIS community took 
many forms, including free distribution of a variety of GIS translators
with source.  The fact that he used this Shapelib in some of his utilities, 
and thanked me was a great encouragement to me.  I hope I can do his memory 
honour by trying to contribute in a similar fashion.<p>

<h2>Portability</h2>

The Shapefile C Library should port easily to 32bit systems with ANSI C
compilers.  It should work on 64 bit architectures (such as the DEC AXP).<p>

Care should also be taken to pass the binary access flag into SHPOpen()
and DBFOpen() when operating on systems with special text file translation
such as MSDOS.<p>

The shputils.c module is contributed, and may not take the same approach
to portability as the rest of the package.<p>

On Linux, and most unix systems it should be possible to build and 
install shapefile support as a shared library using the "lib" and "lib_install"
targets of the Makefile.  Note that this Makefile doesn't use autoconf
mechanisms and will generally require some hand tailoring for your environment.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>

<li> You can't modify the vertices of existing structures (though you 
   can update the attributes of existing structures, and create new 
   structures).<p>

<li> Not written in such a way as to be particularly fast.  This is 
particularly true of the 1.2 API.  For applications more concerned with
speed it may be worth using the V1.1 API.<p>

<li> Doesn't set the last access time properly in the .dbf files.<p>

<li> There is no way to synchronize information to the file except to close it.
<p>

<li> Poor error checking and reporting.<p>

<li> Not professionally supported (well it can be, if you want to pay).<p>

<li> Some aspects of xBase files not supported, though I believe they are
not used by ESRI.<p>

<li> The application must keep the .dbf file in sync with the .shp/.shx
files through appropriate use of the DBF and SHP APIs.<p>

<li> No support for the undocumented .sbn/.sbx spatial index files.<p>

</ul>
