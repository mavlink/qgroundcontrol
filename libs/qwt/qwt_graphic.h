    \brief A paint device for scalable graphics

    QwtGraphic is the representation of a graphic that is tailored for
    scalability. Like QPicture it will be initialized by QPainter
    operations and can be replayed later to any target paint device.

    While the usual image representations QImage and QPixmap are not
    scalable Qt offers two paint devices, that might be candidates
    for representing a vector graphic:

    - QPicture\n
      Unfortunately QPicture had been forgotten, when Qt4
      introduced floating point based render engines. Its API
      is still on integers, what make it unusable for proper scaling.

    - QSvgRenderer/QSvgGenerator\n
      Unfortunately QSvgRenderer hides to much information about
      its nodes in internal APIs, that are necessary for proper 
      layout calculations. Also it is derived from QObject and 
      can't be copied like QImage/QPixmap.

    QwtGraphic maps all scalable drawing primitives to a QPainterPath
    and stores them together with the painter state changes 
    ( pen, brush, transformation ... ) in a list of QwtPaintCommands. 
    For being a complete QPaintDevice it also stores pixmaps or images, 
    what is somehow against the idea of the class, because these objects 
    can't be scaled without a loss in quality.

    The main issue about scaling a QwtGraphic object are the pens used for
    drawing the outlines of the painter paths. While non cosmetic pens 
    ( QPen::isCosmetic() ) are scaled with the same ratio as the path, 
    cosmetic pens have a fixed width. A graphic might have paths with 
    different pens - cosmetic and non-cosmetic.

    QwtGraphic caches 2 different rectangles:

    - control point rectangle\n
      The control point rectangle is the bounding rectangle of all
      control point rectangles of the painter paths, or the target 
      rectangle of the pixmaps/images.

    - bounding rectangle\n
      The bounding rectangle extends the control point rectangle by
      what is needed for rendering the outline with an unscaled pen.

    Because the offset for drawing the outline depends on the shape 
    of the painter path ( the peak of a triangle is different than the flat side ) 
    scaling with a fixed aspect ratio always needs to be calculated from the 
    control point rectangle.

           to a document in a scalable vector format ( PDF, SVG ):
           the width of non cosmetic pens will be scaled by the
           document viewer.
