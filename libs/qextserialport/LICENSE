== Why license needed? ==

 Many users complains that, without a proper licence they can not use this library.

    Hi, 
    we are considering using a modified version of QExtSerialPort in one of our 
    projects (Qt Creator, http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator). 
    Would it be possible to add license header information or a license file to the   
    QExtSerialPort code base? - This would make re-use of the code base easier. 
    If that is not  possible, could we redistribute the source code with BSD- 
    license headers manually added? 

And

    I am also considering packaging the software for Debian, but I 
    couldn't do it yet just because of the license.

    Questions:
    Can I use qextserialport in a commercial product?
    If yes, how?
    Compile it in? I guess no.
    If I can use it as a library, how should the README be formulated?
    Is the "MIT license" from 2008 appropriate?

== Why can we use MIT? ==

Form the history of [http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/2004-12/msg01022.html qt-interest mail list]

 * Wayne Roth, the original author of the project, had said that:

    the code is in the public domain. Do whatever you like with it. Right 
    now I have too many other things to do to put any serious time into
    fixing it.  Trolltech should be aware of this already; they asked 
    about a license when they offered to host the tarball.

 * Stefan Sander, the maintainer of qextserialport on sourceforge, said that

    Hello,
    My project registration at !SourceForge have been approved.
    http://www.sf.net/projects/qextserialport
    I thought an initial licence of Public Domain would be best solution.
    Someone wrote: - Because its public domain, some could fork it under different licenses -

And from [http://groups.google.com/group/qextserialport/browse_thread/thread/fbcddbfb4a0b5a51?pli=1 this thread] on qesp mail list, we can see that, current maintainers and users agree with a MIT licence.

 * Brandon Fosdick,

    I would vote for BSD or MIT :) 

 * Liam Staskawicz,

    That works for me - let's call it MIT and go for it :) 

And from [[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/qextserialport/P_5TrNHBICE this other thread]] on the same mailing list:

 * Michal Policht,

    I agree to license.
