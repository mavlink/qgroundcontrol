            |-- project.pro
            |-- ....
            |-- 3rdparty\
            |     |-- qextserialport\
            |     |

 * Add following line to your qmake project file:

            include(3rdparty/qextserialport/src/qextserialport.pri)

 * Using QextSerialPort in your code. Enjoy it!

            #include "qextserialport.h"
            ....
            QextSerialPort * port = new QextSerialPort();
            ....
            
== How to use (2) ==
