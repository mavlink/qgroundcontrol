# QGroundControl Ground Control Station

## Custom Build Example

To build this sample custom version, simply rename the directory from `custom-example` to `custom` before launching Qt Creator. The build system will automatically find anything in `custom` and incorporate into the build. If you had already run a build before renaming the directory, delete the build directory before running the build. To restore a stock QGroundControl build, rename it back to `custom-example`.
