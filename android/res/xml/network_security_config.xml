    QGC connects to arbitrary local devices (autopilots, video streams)
    whose IPs are unknown at build time.  Android's domain-config does
    not support CIDR notation, so we allow cleartext globally.

    MAVLink over UDP/TCP uses raw sockets (unaffected by this config).
    This primarily enables cleartext HTTP/RTSP for local video streams
    and self-hosted map tile servers.
