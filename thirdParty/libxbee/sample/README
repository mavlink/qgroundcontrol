To use these samples, you must first install libxbee.
To install, simply type `make install` and provide the root password.

If you cannot install the library for any reason, follow these instructions:
  http://code.google.com/p/libxbee/wiki/install_libxbee#But_I_can't_install_it!

The compile line can be found at the top of the source files, surrounded by #ifdef
and #endif. These allow us to run the source file as a shell script. Simply type
`sh simple.c` to compile the simple sample.
If you do not have the library installed, you must edit the compile line, or type
it by hand.
  gcc <sample_file>.c ../obj/api.o -o <sample_file> -lpthread -lrt
