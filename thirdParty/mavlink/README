MAVLink Micro Air Vehicle Message Marshalling Library

This is a library for lightweight communication between
Micro Air Vehicles (swarm) and/or ground control stations.
It serializes C-structs for serial channels and can be used with
any type of radio modem.

MAVLink is licensed under the terms of the Lesser General Public License of the Free Software Foundation (LGPL).
As MAVLink is a header-only library, compiling an application with it is considered "using the libary", not a derived work. MAVLink can therefore be used without limits in any closed-source application without publishing the source code of the closed-source application.

To generate/update packets, select mavlink_standard_message.xml
in the QGroundControl station settings view, select mavlink/include as
the output directory and click on "Save and Generate".
You will find the newly generated/updated message_xx.h files in
the mavlink/include/generated folder.

To use MAVLink, #include the <mavlink.h> file, not the individual
message files. In some cases you will have to add the main folder to the include search path as well. To be safe, we recommend these flags:

gcc -I mavlink/include -I mavlink/include/<your message set, e.g. common>
