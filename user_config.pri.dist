# Specify the MAVLink dialect to compile support for here. This variable is processed
# by QGCExternalLibs.pri, which handles MAVLink configuration. The dialect should 
# correspond to an include folder under `libs/mavlink/include/mavlink/v1.0`. You can
# also force a build to use only common mavlink message by setting MAVLINK_CONF to empty here.
#MAVLINK_CONF = pixhawk

# Override compilation of QGroundControl's features in your build. This overrides the default
# options for QGroundControl. To see what those are, refer to README.md.
# This should be a space-separated list of the constants specified in README.md.
# Uncomment the following line and replace DISABLE_XBEE with any features to override.
