For generating documentation, refer to /doc/README.

## Notes
Please make sure to delete your build folder before re-building. Independent of which 
build system you use (this is not related to Qt or your OS) the dependency checking and 
cleaning is based on the current project revision. So if you change the project and don't remove the build folder before your next build, incremental building can leave you with stale object files.

### QUpgrade
QUpgrade is a submodule (a Git feature like a sub-repository) that contains extra functionality. It is compiled in by default if it has initialized and updated. It can be disabled by specifying the DISABLE_QUPGRADE definition when calling qmake `qmake DEFINES=DISABLE_QUPGRADE`.

To include QUpgrade functionality run the following (only needs to be done once after cloning the qggroundcontrol git repository):
  * `git submodule init`
  * `git submodule update`

The QUpgrade module relies on `libudev` on Linux platforms.

# Build on Mac OSX

To build on Mac OSX (10.6 or later):

### Install SDL

1. Download SDL from:  <http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.14.dmg>
2. From the SDL disk image, copy the `sdl.framework` bundle to `/Library/Frameworks` directory (if you are not an admin copy to `~/Library/Frameworks`)

### Install QT
- - -
1. Download Qt 4.8+ from <http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/4.8/4.8.5/qt-mac-opensource-4.8.5.dmg > 
2. Double click the package installer and follow instructions: <http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/install-mac.html>

### Build QGroundControl
- - -
 (use clang compiler - not gcc)

1. From the terminal go to the `groundcontrol` directory
2. Run `qmake qgroundcontrol.pro -r -spec unsupported/macx-clang CONFIG+=x86_64`
3. Run `make -j4`


# Build on Linux 


To build on Linux:
- - -
    sudo apt-get install phonon libqt4-dev libphonon-dev libphonon4 phonon-backend-gstreamer qtcreator libsdl1.2-dev libflite1 flite1-dev build-essential libopenscenegraph-dev
    cd directory
    git clone https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol.git
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

* go to `libs/thirdParty -> libxbee` 
* Create Library -> Readme file in folder
* Ubuntu Application Menu -> Development -> Qt Creator
* QtCreator Menu File -> Open File or Project..
* Open `directory/qgroundcontrol/qgroundcontrol.pro`
* Hit the green play button to compile and launch it


# Build on Windows
- - -

__GNU GCC / MINGW IS UNTESTED, COULD WORK WITH
VISUAL STUDIO 2008 / 2010 EXPRESS EDITION (FREE!)__

Steps for Visual Studio 2008 / 2010:

Windows XP/7:

1. Download and install the Qt libraries for Windows from https://qt.nokia.com/downloads/ (the Visual Studio 2008 or 2010 version as appropriate)

2. Download and install Visual Studio 2008 or 2010 Express Edition (free) from https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio. If using Visual Studio 2010, make sure you are running at least SP1. There is a linking error you'll encounter otherwise that will prevent compilation.

3. Go to the QGroundControl folder and then to thirdParty/libxbee and build it following the instructions in win32.README

4. Open the Qt Command Prompt program (should be in the Start Menu), navigate to the source folder of QGroundControl and create the Visual Studio project by typing `qmake -tp vc qgroundcontrol.pro`

5. Now start Visual Studio and load the qgroundcontrol.vcproj if using Visual Studio 2008 or qgroundcontrol.vcxproj if using Visual Studio 2010

6. Compile and edit in Visual Studio. If you need to add new files, add them to qgroundcontrol.pro and re-run `qmake -tp vc qgroundcontrol.pro`
