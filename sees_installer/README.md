# Installation instructions.
Latest can be found here:
https://github.com/SEESAI/qgroundcontrol/releases/tag/v4.3.0-0.0.3

But this is the idea:

1. Download the `sees_installer.zip`. <br>
2. Extract the `sees_installer.zip` file, and run the installer script `groundcontrol_install.py`. <br>
This will copy the .AppImage file, the Qgroundcontrol settings file,  and the files necessary to run the application from a desktop shortcut to the required folders and will create them if they don't exist.
3. Copy the GitHub Token from the Notion page: https://www.notion.so/seesai/QGroundcontrol-Sees-flavour-17cf348e991880faa376c0317c9d3ce0 to the `.env` file.
