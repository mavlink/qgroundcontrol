         * is used to prevent z-fighting of the overlapping text.
         * This probably should have been the best option, but all the ATI
         * cards we have encountered so far have serious problems with this.
         * We see little white holes/artifacts in the rendered glyph textures
         * which move around depending on the viewing angle. For moving text,
         * the moving holes give an extremely unpleasant flickering effect.
         * Pumping up the "units" parameter in glPolygonOffset can minimize 
         * this problem, but two other bad side-effects occur if you do this.
         * First, high values will cause problems with clipping, particularly
         * when there are objects behind the text. The drop-shadows or outline
         * may be culled because their computed offset is behind the object or 
         * z-far plane. Second, there is an additional problem associated with
         * the Z-slope. High values can make large chunks of the backdrop
         * suddenly disappear. This can be reduced by the "factor" parameter.
         * Making the "factor" value small, can help, but experimentally, we've
         * found that it creates a new, different kind of z-fighting problem.
         * So there is no perfect solution. With units, you trade off the 'holes'
         * for the large-section clipping.
         * Experimentally, we have found units values from 150-512 to be tolerable
         * to acceptable with respect to the 'holes'. A factor of .1 seems to 
         * bring down the large clipping problem without creating a new z-fighting
         * problem.
         * (You can experiment with these numbers by playing with the 
         * osg:PolygonOffset multipliers which this backend tries to respect.)

         * mode is that render order begins to matter and the text will not 
         * necessarily correctly appear above or behind other objects in the

         * Strangely, experiments on ATI cards seem to produce cleaner results
         * than when using glPolygonOffset. The trade-off for this is that the 
         * backdrop still may be placed too far back and might be culled by objects
         * directly behind the object or by the far z-plane. If ATI ever fixes
         * the glPolygonOffset problem, polygon offset is probably a slightly

         * the most "correct" and reliable way of producing backdrop text.
         * The stencil buffer is a multipass system that allows writing to the 
         * same z-values without needing to resort to offsets. This implementation
         * should not have any of the problems associated with the 3 previous
         * implementations. But the trade-off for this mode is that without 
         * hardware acceleration for the stencil buffer, rendering will be 
         * extremely slow. (There is also potentially more overhead for this 
         * algorithm so it could be slower than the other implementations.
