
This directory and its subdirectories contains the OpenGL Utility
Toolkit (GLUT) distribution.  See the NOTICE for legal terms.

VERSION:

Release 3.7, Novermber 22, 1998.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:

This distribution should compile for:

  o  Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT with Microsoft
     OpenGL 1.1 (bundled standard with these systems) or SGI OpenGL
     for Windows (aka Cosmo OpenGL).
  
  o  SGI workstation running IRIX 5.2 or higher supporting OpenGL,
     including 64-bit and N32 support IRIX 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and
     6.5.

  o  DEC Alpha workstation running OSF/1 and OpenVMS with Open3D
     layered product.

  o  IBM RS/6000 workstations running AIX with OpenGL support.

  o  Metro Link's Metro OpenGL for Linux.

  o  Sun's OpenGL implementation for its workstations or Template
     Graphics Software's OpenGL for Sun workstations.

  o  Mesa 3.x (and 2.x) for Unix workstations, including Linux PCs
     and SunOS 4.1.x.

  o  Most other Unix workstations supporting either OpenGL or Mesa.

MICROSOFT WINDOWS 95 and NT BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:   <-- IMPORTANT!

Read the "README-win32.txt" accompanying file.

MESA BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:                          <-- IMPORTANT!

Mesa 3.x and higher provide an implementation of GLUT in Mesa's
"MesaDemos" source code distribution.  The official GLUT source
code distribution may or may not be more current than the version
of the GLUT library included with the MesaDemos distribution.

Please note that even though the MesaDemos distribution contains
the source code for the GLUT library, the many GLUT source code
examples and demos in the GLUT source code distribution are not
part of Mesa.

To ease building the GLUT source code distribution for Mesa,
users, see the note in the Glut.cf file in this directory.  If
you uncomment the line saying "#define UseMesa 1" and then
set the "MesaDir" #define to the location of your Mesa source
code distribution, GLUT should build easily with Mesa.

MAKEFILE GENERATION TO BUILD GLUT:                <-- IMPORTANT!

Use "mkmkfiles.sgi" to put Makefiles using the SGI Makefile conventions
in place.  Use "mkmkfiles.imake" to put Makefiles generated from
Imakefiles in place.  Run one of these two commands in this directory,
then do a "make".

DOCUMENTATION:

See the other README files in this directory.  There is a complete
specification for GLUT API version 3 in PostScript available by
anonymous ftp accompanying this distribution.  GLUT includes a full set
of nroff man pages for the GLUT API version 3.  nroff man pages for
GLE are also included.

ACCOMPANYING DATA FILES:

Another separate GLUT data distribution contains a "data" subdirectory
containing large data files used by some of the examples in the
"progs/advanced" subdirectory.  See the file "progs/advanced/README"
for more details.

GLUT MAILING LIST:

To subscribe to the GLUT mailing list, send an electronic mail message
with the word "subscribe" in the first line of the message to
glut-request@perp.com  Messages intended for the GLUT mailing list can
be sent to glut@prep.com

A SHAMELESS BUT HOPEFULLY HELPFUL PLUG:

I've written a book titled "Programming OpenGL for the X Window System"
(ISBN: 0-201-48359-9) published by Addison-Wesley.  It includes both a
complete tutorial and documentation for GLUT, as well as a full
explanation of using OpenGL with the X Window System's Xlib and
Xt/Motif interfaces.  If you use GLUT, I believe you'll find this
book very informative.  See:

  http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/OpenGLforX.html

BUG REPORTING:

Send bug reports by electronic mail to mjk@nvidia.com (I now work
for NVIDIA Corporation, not Silicon Graphics).

Questions of a general interest about GLUT will be answered on the
comp.graphics.api.opengl newsgroup.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

Much thanks to OpenGL engineers at DEC, IBM, Microsoft, SGI, Sun, and
TGS.  Of particular mention are Brian Paul from the University of
Wisconsin, Nate Robins at the Univeristy of Utah, and Craig Groeschel
of Metro Link Inc. for helping me ensure the portability of this code
to non-SGI graphics platforms.  Also thank you to GLUT users who
supplied me with feedback and bug fixes.

Nate Robin's effort to combine his Win32 GLUT with GLUT 3.5 were most
excellent.  Tom Davis contributed the micro-UI library.  GLUT 3.5's
testing on PCs was greatly aided by Petri Nordlund, Brian Buchner,
Leath Muller, Stephen Speicher, and I've probably missed others.  Henk
Kok is responsible for the several way cool demos in GLUT 3.5.  Thanks
for your help!
