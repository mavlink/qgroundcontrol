This directory has code for using texture mapped fonts.  For more
information on this code, see:

  http://reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/tips/TexFont/TexFont.html

Here is a quick description of the programs:

  gentexfont - program to capture X fonts from an X server and
     write out .txf files usable the TexFont API.

  showtxf - a program to show the texture encoded within .txf
     files generated by gentexfont.

  txfdemo - a demonstration of texture mapped text using the TexFont
     API to put text on a spinning cube, including text wrapped in a
     circle.

  simpletxf - a very simple TexFont program showing how to rotate
     texture mapped text around.

The directory also contains some sample .txf files (that can be used
with the demonstration programs);

  curlfont.txf
  default.txf
  djb.txf
  haeberli.txf
  rockfont.txf
  sorority.txf

Of course, with gentexfont, you can generate your own.
