
The geoface example in this directory is a modified version of the code
presented in Appendix 1 of Frederic I Parke and Keith Waters's most
interesting book "Computer Facial Animation" (A.K. Peters, ISBN
1-56881-014-8).  Information about the book can be found at:

  http://www.research.digital.com/CRL/personal/waters/book.html

From the book's Preface:

  This book is about computer facial models, computer generated facial
  images, and facial animation. In particular it concerns the
  principles of creating face models and the manipulation or control of
  computer generated facial attributes. In addition, various sections
  in the book describe and explain the development of specific computer
  facial animation techniques over the past twenty years, as well as
  those expected in the near future.

The original Appendix 1 code (using the aux library) can be found at:

I've improved the code to add menus, better mouse motion handling,
arrow key support, and less terminal output.

DEC has a program called DECface that looks even more involved:

If the example here intrigues you, you'll definitely want the book.
