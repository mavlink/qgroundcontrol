
This is a nice 3D system monitor written with GLUT.  The operating
system dependent code for querying system statistics is only for IRIX,
but maybe someone could adapt the code to work on other operating
systems.

Be warned that on a multiprocessor SGI systems, some of the
measurements go "off the chart".  The program was written on a single
processor machine so the top of the chart is 100% of one processor.
