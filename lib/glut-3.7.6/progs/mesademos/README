The source code in this directory is derived from a set of demos found
in the Mesa 2.0 source code distribution.  The original Mesa demos
were written to use Xlib, aux, or tk; the versions in this directory
have been converted to use GLUT.

Some of the programs from the Mesa 2.0 demos directory are not
included here because they demonstrated features specific to Mesa.  To
avoid any possible confusion, the Mesa 2.0 demo source files NOT
reproduced here are fdraw.f, ftest.c, glxdemo.c, glxpixmap.c, test0.c,
vgears.c, vindex.c, vtest.c, and xdemo.c

Many thanks to Brian Paul and the various contributors to the Mesa
library.

NOTE to SGI users:  IRIX includes a system command called
/usr/sbin/gamma so you may need to run "./gamma" to run the gamma
demo in this directory.
