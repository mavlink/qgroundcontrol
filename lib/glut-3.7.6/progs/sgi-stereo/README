This directory contains a GLUT "hack" program for using SGI's
proprietary X stereo extension (officially named
"SGIFullScreenStereo").  The extension provides stereo support for
mid-range and low-end SGI workstations including Indy and Indigo^2
workstations with Indy, XL, XZ, Extreme, and IMPACT graphics options.

NOTE:  This example "hacks" GLUT to get at private GLUT implementation
variables (basically __glutDisplay).  Any program that does so is
effectively unportable to other GLUT implementations.  SGI's
proprietary X stereo extension is not suitable for portable, direct
support via GLUT's API, so these examples are being released as an
exception to the rule.

To use this example code effectively, you must have:

  o  A low-end or mid-range SGI workstation described above.

  o  IRIX 5.3, 6.1 (Power Indigo^2), 6.2, or higher.

  o  A set of stereo LCD shutter goggles.

  o  A monitor that syncs to the stereo video signal.

To get more information on SGIFullScreenStereo, try:

  man XSGISetStereoBuffer

Mike Blackwell contributed the original GLUT stereo example.  The
example itself is based on a demonstration program found in Appendix 1
of "The CrystalEyes Handbook" by Lenny Lipton, 1991, StereoGraphics
Corp.
