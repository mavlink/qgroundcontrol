These are GLUT-based OpenGL examples that develop the idea of real-time
dynamic environment mapping using sphere maps.  The examples were
originally presented at the Computer Game Developers Convention (CGDC)
in Long Beach, CA on May 5, 1998.

The "glsmap" directory contains examples that use the glsmap dynamic
sphere mapping library API (see ../../lib/glsmap for the library's
source code).  The "hacks" directory contains a few examples that
demonstrate the functional building blocks for dynamic sphere mapping
(and do not use the glsmap library).
