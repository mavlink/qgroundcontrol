This directory contains an example of using a simple GLUT benchmark
harness to construct portable application-specific OpenGL benchmarks.

For more information on this code and how to construction
application-specific OpenGL benchmarks with the gl_harness.c in this
directory, see Section 6.6.8 of my book "Programming OpenGL for the X
Window System" (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-48359-9).  See:

  http://reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/OpenGLforX.html

Because the benchmark harness uses GLUT, the benchmarks created work on
any GLUT-capable window system (not just X11).

Example runs:

  % torus_test
  Renders/second = 2.90951
    after 30 iterations over 10.311 seconds

  % torus_test -iters 40
  Renders/second = 2.90846
    after 40 iterations over 13.753 seconds

  % torus_test -time 5 -depth
  Renders/second = 2.53678
    after 15 iterations over 5.913 seconds

  % torus_test -depth -light
  Renders/second = 1.82515
    after 20 iterations over 10.958 seconds

  % torus_test -geometry 100x100 -depth -light
  Renders/second = 2.00981
    after 25 iterations over 12.439 seconds

Good luck with your benchmarking.
