
This directory contains OpenGL examaples from the SIGGRAPH '96 course
titled "Programming with OpenGL: Advanced Rendering" taught by Tom
McReynolds (tomcat@sgi.com) and David Blythe (blythe@sgi.com), both
from SGI.  These examples demonstrate interesting rendering techniques
that may not be obvious to the beginning OpenGL user.  Think of OpenGL
as a powerful vocabulary for rendering, and you'll be surprised the
powerful expressions that you can devise.

Information about the course is at:

In a few places, I've taken the liberty of adding GLUT popup menus and
disabling animation when the window is iconfied.  Warnings and bugs I
found were fixed.  In a few examples, the degree of tesselation and
default window size have been scaled down to perform better on low-end
graphics workstations and PCs.

A number of SGI .rgb image files are used to supply texture data needed
by some of these examples.  Since the files are large, I am not
including them in the GLUT distribution.  Instead, they are provided in
a separate distribution called glut_data.tar.gz

If you retrieve glut_data.tar.gz, it will generate a glut-3.3/data
directory where the images will be placed.  Use the "make links" target
to make links in this directory into the glut-3.3/data directory.

You can also get the files individually over the Internet from:
