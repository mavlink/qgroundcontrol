# QGroundControl License Information

QGroundControl is licensed under a dual-license system to allow maximum flexibility for users and contributors.

## Dual-License System

QGroundControl is available under **both** the Apache License 2.0 and the GNU General Public License v3 (GPL v3). You may choose which license you want to use based on your use case.

### Apache License 2.0

The [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) is a permissive license which allows QGroundControl to be built and used in any environment, including proprietary applications. It allows QGroundControl to be built for mobile app stores.

**Note**: When building with Apache 2.0, a commercial Qt license is required.

**Full License**: See [LICENSE-APACHE](../LICENSE-APACHE) in the root directory.

### GNU General Public License v3 (GPL v3)

The [GPL v3 License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) is a strong copyleft license. When building QGroundControl under this license, the open source version of Qt can be used.

Our licensing grants the permission to use a later version of the license; however, contributions must be made under GPL v3.

**Full License**: See [LICENSE-GPL](../LICENSE-GPL) in the root directory.

## Contributing to QGroundControl

Contributions must be made under QGroundControl's dual-license system (both GPL v3 AND Apache 2.0). This by definition rules out the re-use of any copyleft (e.g., GPL-only) licensed code.

**All contributions must be:**
- Original work, OR
- From a compatible license: BSD 2-clause, BSD 3-clause, MIT, or Apache 2.0
