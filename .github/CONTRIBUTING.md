# QGroundControl License

Thank you for considering to contribute to QGroundControl.

Contributions must be made under QGroundControl's dual-license system, under GPLv3 and Apache 2.0. This by definition rules out the re-use of any copyleft (e.g. GPL) licensed code. All contributions must be original or from a compatible license (BSD 2/3 clause, MIT, Apache 2.0).

## Apache 2.0 License

The [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) License is a permissive license which allows QGC to be built and used in any environment, including proprietary applications. It allows QGC to be built for mobile app stores. When building with Apache 2.0 a commercial Qt license is required.

## GPL v3 License

The [GPL v3 License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) is a strong copyleft license. When building QGC under this license the open source version of Qt can be used. Our licensing grants the permission to use a later version of the license, however, contributions have to be made under 3.0.

## Contact

If you have questions regarding the licensing, please contact the maintainer Lorenz Meier, [lm@groundcontrol.org].
