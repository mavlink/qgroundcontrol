Tell us a bit about the feature:
- What problem does it solve?
- What does it do?
- What flight stacks must it work with? (All, PX4, ArduPilot)
- Relevant vehicle types? (All, multirotor, fixed-wing, VTOL, submarine, etc.)
- Are there other systems that have this feature?
- What communication/integration standards does the feature rely on (e.g. MAVLink commands etc.)

Any additional context you can provide will make the feature easier to evaluate (e.g. mockups, detailed specification, etc.)
