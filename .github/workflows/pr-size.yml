            ## ⚠️ Large PR Warning

            This PR has **more than 1000 lines** changed, which can be difficult to review thoroughly.

            Consider:
            - Splitting into smaller, focused PRs
            - Separating refactoring from feature changes
            - Breaking out unrelated changes into separate PRs

            Smaller PRs get reviewed faster and reduce the risk of bugs slipping through.
