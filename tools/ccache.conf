# ccache configuration for QGroundControl
#
# This file is automatically loaded by CMake via CCACHE_CONFIGPATH.
# CMake also sets these environment variables (which override config values):
#   - CCACHE_DIR = <project>/.cache/ccache
#   - CCACHE_BASEDIR = <project>
#   - CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK = content (macOS only)
#
# For standalone use (run from project root):
#   export CCACHE_CONFIGPATH=$PWD/tools/ccache.conf

# Cache directory - set by CMake via CCACHE_DIR environment variable
# cache_dir = .cache/ccache

# Base directory - set by CMake via CCACHE_BASEDIR environment variable
# base_dir = .

# Maximum cache size
max_size = 2G

# Compression level (1-19, higher = smaller but slower)
compression_level = 5

# Allow ccache to work with precompiled headers and time-based macros
sloppiness = pch_defines,time_macros,include_file_mtime,include_file_ctime

# Skip running preprocessor twice (improves performance)
