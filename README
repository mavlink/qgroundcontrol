sudo apt-get install phonon libqt4-dev \
 libphonon-dev libphonon4 phonon-backend-gstreamer \
qtcreator libsdl1.2-dev libflite1 flite1-dev build-essential

cd directory

git clone https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol.git

go to thirdParty -> libxbee 

Create Library -> Readme file in folder

Ubuntu Application Menu -> Development -> Qt Creator

QtCreator Menu File -> Open File or Project..

Open directory/qgroundcontrol/qgroundcontrol.pro

Hit the green play button to compile and launch it

Done.


Windows
=======

GNU GCC / MINGW IS UNTESTED, COULD WORK
VISUAL STUDIO 2008 / 2010 EXPRESS EDITION IS FREE!

Steps for Visual Studio 2008 / 2010:

Windows XP/7:

1) Download and install the Qt libraries for Windows from https://qt.nokia.com/downloads/ (the Visual Studio 2008 or 2010 version as appropriate)

2) Download and install Visual Studio 2008 or 2010 Express Edition (free) from https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio

3) Go to the QGroundControl folder and then to thirdParty/libxbee and build it following the instructions in win32.README

4) Open the Qt Command Prompt program (should be in the Start Menu), navigate to the source folder of QGroundControl and create the Visual Studio project by typing:

`qmake -tp vc qgroundcontrol.pro`

5) Now start Visual Studio and load the qgroundcontrol.vcproj if using Visual Studio 2008 or qgroundcontrol.vcxproj if using Visual Studio 2010

6) Compile and edit in Visual Studio. If you need to add new files, add them to qgroundcontrol.pro and re-run `qmake -tp vc qgroundcontrol.pro
