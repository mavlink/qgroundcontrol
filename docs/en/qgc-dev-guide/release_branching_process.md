# QGroundControl Release/Branching process

## Semantic Versioning

QGC uses semantic versioning for the version numbers associated with its releases.
Semantic versioning is a 3-component number in the format of `vX.Y.Z`, where:

- `X` is the major version.
- `Y` is the minor version.
- `Z` is the patch version.

## Stable Builds

The current stable build is the highest quality build available for QGC.
[Patch releases](#patch_releases) of the stable build are regularly made to fix important issues.

Stable builds are built from a separate branch that is named with the format: `Stable_VX.Y` (note, there is no patch number!)
The branch has one or more git tags for each patch release (with the format `vX.Y.Z`), indicating the point in the repo source code that the associated patch release was created from.

### Patch Releases {#patch_releases}

A patch release contains fixes to the stable release that are important enough to _require_ an update, and are safe enough that the stable release continues to maintain high quality.

Patch releases increment the patch version number only.

### Patch - Development Stage

Approved fixes to the stable release are commited to the current stable branch.
These fixes continue to queue up in the stable branch until a patch release is made (see next step).

Commits/changes to the stable branch must also be brought over to the master branch (either through cherry pick or separate pulls).

### Patch - Release Stage

At the point where the decision is made to do a patch release, the release binaries are created and a new _tag_ is added to the stable branch (with the same patch release number) indicating the associated source code.

::: info
New branches are not created for patch releases - only for major and minor releases.

## Daily Builds

### Development Stage

Daily builds are built from the `master` branch, and this is where all new major feature development happens.
The state of master represents either the next minor point release, or a new major version release (depending on the level of change).

There are no git tags associated with a released daily builds.
The released daily build will always match repo HEAD.

### Release Stage

When the decision is made to release a new major/minor version the master branch tends to go through an intial lockdown mode.
This is where only important fixes for the release are accepted as pull requests.

::: info
During the lockdown phase, new features are not allowed in master.
:::

Once the level of fixes associated with the release slows down to a low level, a new stable branch is created (at this point the `master` branch can move forward again as the latest and greatest).

Fixes continue in the stable branch until it is deemed ready to release (ideally after a short time)!
At that point the new stable branch is tagged with the new version tag and the first stable release is made.

## Custom Builds

A proposed strategy for branching on custom builds can be found [here](custom_build/release_branching_process.md).

## Process to create a new Stable

### Major/Minor Version

1. Create a branch from master named `Stable_VX.Y` where `X` is the major version number and `Y` is the minor version number.
1. Create a tag on the HEAD of master name `dX.Y` where the minor version is one greater than the new Stable. For example if you are create a new Stable 4.2 version then the tag would be 'd4.3'. This tag is used to create the version numbers for Android daily builds. Example: `git tag -a d4.3.0 -m "QGroundControl Daily Android Version Base"`.
1. Create an annotated tag on the newly created Stable branch named `vX.Y.0` with the correct major/minor version number. Example: `git tag -a v4.2.0 -m "QGroundControl v4.2.0"`. Pushing this tag to the repo will start a build.
1. Once the build completes verify the builds are pushed up to S3 correctly and sanity check that they at least boot correctly. Location on S3 will be `https://qgroundcontrol.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/latest/...`.
1. Update the `https://qgroundcontrol.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/builds/latest/QGC.version.txt` text file to the latest Stable version. This will notify uses there is a new Stable available the next time they launch QGC.

### Patch Version

Creating a new Patch Version is the same except you skip steps 1 and 2 and in step 3 you bump the patch version number up as needed.
