### Flight Status

The Flight Status indicator shows you whether the vehicle is ready to fly or not. It can be in one of the following states:

- **Ready To Fly** (_green background_) - Vehicle is ready to fly
- **Ready To Fly** (_yellow background_) - Vehicle is ready to fly in the current flight mode. But there are warnings which may cause problems.
- **Not Ready** - Vehicle is not ready to fly and will not takeoff.
- **Armed** - Vehicle is armed and ready to Takeoff.
- **Flying** - Vehicle is in the air and flying.
- **Landing** - Vehicle is in the process of landing.
- **Communication Lost** - QGroundControl has lost communication with the vehicle.

The Flight Status Indicator dropdown also gives you acess to:

- **Arm** - Arming a vehicle starts the motors in preparation for takeoff. You will only be able to arm the vehicle if it is safe and ready to fly. Generally you do not need to manually arm the vehicle. You can simply takeoff or start a mission and the vehicle will arm itself.
- **Disarm** - Disarming a vehicle is only availble when the vehicle is on the ground. It will stop the motors. Generally you do not need to explicitly disarm as vehicles will disarm automatically after landing, or shortly after arming if you do not take off.
- **Emergency Stop** - Emergency stop is used to disarm the vehicle while it is flying. For emergency use only, your vehicle will crash!

In the cases of warnings or not ready state you can click the indicator to display the dropdown which will show the reason(s) why. The toggle on the right expands each error with additional information and possible solutions.

Once each issue is resolved it will disappear from the UI. When all issues blocking arming have been removed you should now be ready to fly.
