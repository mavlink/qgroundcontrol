## Linux Installation Instructions

1. Make the AppImage executable
```
chmod +x QGroundControl-<arch>.AppImage
```

2. Enable serial-port access
Add your user to the dialout group so you can talk to USB devices without root:

```
sudo usermod -aG dialout "$(id -un)"
```

::: info
At login, your shell takes a snapshot of your user and group memberships. Because you just changed groups, you need a fresh login shell to pick up “dialout” access. Logging out and back in reloads that snapshot, so you get the new permissions.

3. (Optional) Disable ModemManager
On some Ubuntu-based systems, ModemManager can claim serial ports that QGC needs. If you don't use it elsewhere, mask or remove it.
```
# preferred: stop and mask the service
sudo systemctl mask --now ModemManager.service

# or, if you’d rather remove the package
sudo apt remove --purge modemmanager
```

4. Run QGroundControl
Either double-click the AppImage in your file manager or launch it from a terminal:

```
./QGroundControl-<arch>.AppImage
```
