## System Requirements

QGC should run well on any modern computer or mobile device. Performance will depend on the system environment, 3rd party applications, and available system resources.
More capable hardware will provide a better experience.
A computer with at least 8Gb RAM, an SSD, Nvidia or AMD graphics and an i5 or better CPU will be suitable for most applications.

For the best experience and compatibility, we recommend you the newest version of your operating system.

   sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
   sudo apt-get remove modemmanager -y
   sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-gl -y
   sudo apt install libqt5gui5 -y
   sudo apt install libfuse2 -y
   ```
   <!-- Note, remove install of libqt5gui5 https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol/issues/10176 fixed -->
1. Logout and login again to enable the change to user permissions.
