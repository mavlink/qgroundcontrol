# QGroundControl Quick Start

Getting _QGroundControl_ up and running is quick and easy:

1. [Download and install (Daily 5.0)](../releases/daily_builds.md) the application.
1. Start _QGroundControl_.
1. Attach your vehicle to the ground station device via USB, through a telemetry radio, or over WiFi. _QGroundControl_ should detect your vehicle and connect to it automatically.

That's it! If the vehicle is ready to fly, _QGroundControl_ should display [Fly View](../fly_view/fly_view.md) as shown below (otherwise it will open [Setup View](../setup_view/setup_view.md)).

A good way to become familiar with _QGroundControl_ is to start experimenting:

- Use the View Selector to switch between main views:
  - Plan Flight
  - Analyze Tools
  - Vehicle Configuration
  - Application Settings
- Click the _Status Indicators_ on the toolbar to find out the status of the connected vehicle.

While the UI is fairly intuitive, this documentation can also be referenced to find out more.

Make sure QGC has an internet connection when you connect a new vehicle in order to display map content.
