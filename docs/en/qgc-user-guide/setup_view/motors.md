Motor Setup is used to test individual motors/servos (for example, to verify that motors spin in the correct direction).

These instructions apply to PX4 and to most vehicle types on ArduPilot.
Vehicle-specific instructions are provided as sub-topics (e.g. [Motors Setup (ArduSub)](../setup_view/motors_ardusub.md)).

4. Adjust the slider to select the power for the motors.

5. Press the button corresponding to the motor and confirm it spin in the correct direction.
