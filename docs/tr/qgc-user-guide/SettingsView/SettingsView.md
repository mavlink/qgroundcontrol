# Settings View

The *Settings View* is used to configure the settings for the *QGroundControl* application (rather than a specific vehicle). You do not have to have a vehicle connected to change these values.

You can switch between the various settings options by clicking the buttons in the left-sidebar.

## Settings Options

**[General](General.md)** <br />The main application configuration settings. These are used to specify: display units, autoconnection devices, video display and storage, RTK GPS, etc.

**Comm Links** <br />Allows you to manually create communication links and connect to them. *Keep in mind that normally this is not needed since QGroundControl will automatically connect to the most common devices.*

**[Offline Maps](OfflineMaps.md)** <br />Allows you to cache maps for use while you have no Internet connection.

**[MAVLink](MAVLink.md)** <br />Settings associated with the MAVLink connection to a vehicle.

**[Console](console_logging.md)** <br />Used to capture application logs for help with diagnosing application problems.
