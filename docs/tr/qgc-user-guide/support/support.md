### Reporting Bugs

If you are directed to create an issue, please use the "Bug report" template and provide all information specified in the template.

##### Reporting Crashes from Windows Builds

When QGC crashes a crash dump file will be place in the Users LocalAppData directory. To navigate to that directory use the Start/Run command. You can bring this up window WinKey+R. Type into that `%localappdata%` for Open and click Ok. Crash dumps will be in a `QGCCrashDumps` folder in that directory. You should find a new **.dmp** file there. Add a link to that file in a GitHub Issue when reporting you problem.

##### Reporting Hangs from Windows Builds

If Windows is telling you the _QGroundControl program is unresponsive_ use the following steps to report the hang:

1. Open _Task Manager_ (right-click TaskBar, select **Task Manager**)
2. Switch to the Processes tab and local **qgroundcontrol.exe**
3. Right-click on **groundcontrol.exe** and select **Create Dump File**
4. Place the dump file in a public location
5. Add a link to the **.dmp** file and above details in the GitHub issue.
