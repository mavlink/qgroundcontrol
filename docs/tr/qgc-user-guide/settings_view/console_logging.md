## Logging from the Command Line

An alternate mechanism for logging is using the `--logging` command line option. This is handy if you are trying to get logs from a situation where _QGroundControl_ crashes.

How you do this and where the traces are output vary by OS:

- Windows

  - You must open a command prompt, change directory to the **qgroundcontrol.exe** location, and run it from there:
    bash
    cd "\Program Files (x86)\qgroundcontrol"
    qgroundcontrol --logging:full

    ```sh
    cd "\Program Files (x86)\qgroundcontrol"
    qgroundcontrol --logging:full
    ```

  - When _QGroundControl_ starts you should see a separate console window open which will have the log output

- OSX

  - You must run _QGroundControl_ from Terminal. The Terminal app is located in Applications/Utilities. Once Terminal is open paste the following into it:

    ```sh
    Once Terminal is open paste the following into it:
        bash
        cd /Applications/qgroundcontrol.app/Contents/MacOS/
        ./qgroundcontrol --logging:full
    ```

  - Log traces will output to the Terminal window.

- Linux

  ```sh
  bash
  ./qgroundcontrol-start.sh --logging:full
  ```

  - Log traces will output to the shell you are running from.
