# QGroundControl快速上手指南

让 _QGroundControl_ 轻松入门上手使用：

1. [Download and install (Daily 5.0)](../releases/daily_builds.md) the application.
2. 启动_QGroundControl_。
3. Attach your vehicle to the ground station device via USB, through a telemetry radio, or over WiFi. _QGroundControl_ should detect your vehicle and connect to it automatically.

That's it! 就这么简单！ 如果设备准备飞行（无人机是飞，其它设备是运行），_QGroundControl_应显示如下[Fly View](../fly_view/fly_view.md) (否则将打开[Setup View](../setup_view/setup_view.md))。

要想把_QGroundControl_玩的纯熟，最好方法是亲自上手折腾：

- Use the View Selector to switch between main views:
  - Plan Flight
  - Analyze Tools
  - Vehicle Configuration
  - Application Settings
- Click the _Status Indicators_ on the toolbar to find out the status of the connected vehicle.

While the UI is fairly intuitive, this documentation can also be referenced to find out more.

Make sure QGC has an internet connection when you connect a new vehicle in order to display map content.
