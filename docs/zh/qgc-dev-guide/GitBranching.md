# Git Branching

## Semantic Versioning

QGC uses semantic version for the version numbers associated with its releases. Semantic versioning is a 3-component number in the format of `vX.Y.Z`, where:

- `X` is the major version.
- `Y` is the minor version.
- `Z` is the patch version.

## Stable Builds

The current stable build is the highest quality build available for QGC. [Patch releases](#patch_releases) of the stable build are regularly made to fix important issues.

Stable builds are built from a separate branch that is named with the format: `Stable_VX.Y` (note, there is no patch number!) The branch has one or more git tags for each patch release (with the format `vX.Y.Z`), indicating the point in the repo source code that the associated patch release was created from.

### Patch Releases {#patch_releases}

A patch release contains fixes to the stable release that are important enough to _require_ an update, and are safe enough that the stable release continues to maintain high quality.

Patch releases increment the patch version number only.

### Patch - Development Stage

Approved fixes to the stable release are commited to the current stable branch. These fixes continue to queue up in the stable branch until a patch release is made (see next step).

Commits/changes to the stable branch must also be brought over to the master branch (either through cherry pick or separate pulls).

### Patch - Release Stage

At the point where the decision is made to do a patch release, the release binaries are created and a new _tag_ is added to the stable branch (with the same patch release number) indicating the associated source code.

::: info
New branches are not created for patch releases - only for major and minor releases.

## Daily Builds

### Development Stage

Daily builds are built from the `master` branch, and this is where all new major feature development happens. The state of master represents either the next minor point release, or a new major version release (depending on the level of change).

There are no git tags associated with a released daily builds. The released daily build will always match repo HEAD.

### Release Stage

When the decision is made to release a new major/minor version the master branch tends to go through an intial lockdown mode. This is where only important fixes for the release are accepted as pull requests.

::: info
During the lockdown phase, new features are not allowed in master.
:::

Once the level of fixes associated with the release slows down to a low level, a new stable branch is created (at this point the `master` branch can move forward again as the latest and greatest).

Fixes continue in the stable branch until it is deemed ready to release (ideally after a short time)! At that point the new stable branch is tagged with the new version tag and the first stable release is made.

## Custom Builds

A proposed strategy for branching on custom builds can be found [here](custom_build/GitBranching.md).
